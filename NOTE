This repo was created to test the following:

# this was lesson-01 
# task: create a repo > add a file > chk the 'git status' > to see if the update is shown.
# originally thought about deleting the local win fld (hence the fld name) but now keeping. 
# fld is marked as READ-ONLY probably by github so that there is consistency between winExplorer and github. 
# If rename the fld could cause issues.
